// Using EJS and HTML, code the urls_index.ejs file to display the following:
// A list or table of the URLs and their shortened forms. If you need a reminder on how to loop through data with EJS, take another peek at the What is a Template Engine? Reading.
// A link for shortening a new URL. This will be a dead link for now (href='#') as we will build the page for this functionality later.

const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const PORT = 8080; // default port 8080

//This tells the Express app to use EJS as its templating engine.

// Notice the external link we've included in the <head> tag; this stylesheet is from Bootstrap,
// one of the most popular CSS frameworks around. We'll use it in our app so that we have some basic CSS
// styling available to us. We've also included a number of <script> tags at the bottom of our <body>;
// these javascript files are required by some of the components in Bootstrap.
